# Image Analysis Notebooks for High-Content Screening Data
Jupyter notebooks for analysis of high-content screening data. Morphological profiling of coculture screens was carried out using [bioimg](https://github.com/vladchimescu/bioimg).

## Coculture screen
In this imaging-based screen, 50 compounds were probed in 108 primary leukemia and lymphoma samples. The [coculture](https://github.com/vladchimescu/microscopy-notebooks/tree/master/coculture_profiling) directory contains a number of notebooks on:
+ morphological profiling
+ feature selection in AML and CLL
+ dimension reduction in AML and CLL


## Bispecific antibody (BiTE) screen
In this [study](https://ashpublications.org/bloodadvances/article/5/23/5060/477075/An-autologous-culture-model-of-nodal-B-cell), bispecific T cell engagers (BiTEs) were screened in autologous B and T cell coculture derived from lymphoma samples. The [BiTE](https://github.com/vladchimescu/microscopy-notebooks/tree/master/BiTE) directory contains a number of notebooks on segmentation of B and T cell coculture as well as cluster-based profiling.
